# LGMVIP-DataScience
Data Science Internship at LETS GROW MORE

# About Company:

LETSGROWMORE is a community of diverse people coming together 
with similar objectives and ultimate goals. LETS GROW MORE deep downed its 
roots at the very beginning of this year as a result of an idea that was brought up 
to be real by the Founder of LETSGROWMORE - AMAN KESARWANI.

# TASK1:Iris Flowers Classification ML Project 

Problem:

This particular ML project is usually referred 
to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers 
dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to 
learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also,
since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.

# TASK2:Image to Pencil Sketch with Python

Problem:

We need to read the image in RBG format and then convert it to a grayscale image.
This will turn an image into a classic black and white photo. 
Then the next thing to do is invert the grayscale image also called negative image,
this will be our inverted grayscale image. Inversion can be used to enhance details.
Then we can finally create the pencil sketch by mixing the grayscale image with the inverted blurry image. 
This can be done by dividing the grayscale image by the inverted blurry image. Since images are just arrays,
we can easily do this programmatically using the divide function from the cv2 library in Python.
